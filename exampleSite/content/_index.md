The Hubbardton Historical Society was organized in 2000. The society records, promotes and preserves the history of the town of Hubbardton. We seek to develop an interest in America's history among young people.  Our headquarters are located next to the Hubbardton Battlefield. We have begun collecting items for a museum.

Other activities include education, genealogy, local history research, and supporting the Battle of Hubbardton reenactment.

The upcoming Battle of Hubbardton Revolutionary War Encampment will be July 6th-7th 2024. The battle will commence at 7:45AM on July 7th. <!--$8 for adults, $1 ages 6-14, free under age 6, free for Green Mountain  Passport holders.-->
