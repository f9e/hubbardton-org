One of the most successful rear guard actions in American history, the Battle of Hubbardton was the only Revolutionary War battle fought entirely in Vermont. During the early morning hours of July 7, 1777, British General John Burgoyne's army met the resistance and bravery of Americans for the first time in the Battle of Hubbardton. A massive British invasion from Canada chased the Continental Army from Mount Independence south to Hubbardton.

The British strategy was to continue to New York and divide New England from the rest of the colonies. The advancing British were seasoned Regulars. The Green Mountain Boys stayed behind to slow down the Redcoats so that the main force could retreat. On a grassy hill, the scrappy New Englanders made their stand. While the British held the field and technically won the battle, their losses were so heavy that they gave up chasing the Americans to tend to their casualties.

The Battle of Hubbardton marked the beginning of the end for Burgoyne and his great plan. On August 16 he suffered a stunning blow at the Battle of Bennington. Soon after Burgoyne wrote about the people of Vermont as "the most active and most rebellious race on the continent" and that they were hanging "like a gathering storm" on his left.

On October 17, 1777, after the battles of Saratoga, he surrendered with his entire Army.
